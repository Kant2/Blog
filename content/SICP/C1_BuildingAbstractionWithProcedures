program -> (computaional)process -> data
The usage of Process just like socerer's spell, we use it to influent the nature.
  must working precisely and accurately(like socerer's apprentice).
  is less dangerous than sorcery, but can also cause catastrophic.
  Master engineer & Well designed computational system.
  
Programming in Lisp:
  Apropriate for describe Process.-Procedure thought
  Some introductions of Lisp, we use Scheme
  more efficient than before, But still inefficient(can use in efficiency is not the central concern).
  Feature: handing procedures as data

1.Elements:
  primitive language: simplest item the language concerned with.
  means of combination: compound elements.
  means of abstraction: named and built as unit.
  procedures -(combine & abstract)-> data
  
  (Primitive) Expression:12
    Compound expression: (+(primitive procedure/Operator) 12(Operands/Arguments) 32) -> Combination
    Prefix notation: 1.accommodate arbitrary arguments
      2.nested combination more straightforward.
    Pretty-printing
    read-eval-print Loop
  Naming & the Environment:
